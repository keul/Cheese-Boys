Cheese Boys - HISTORY & CHANGES
===============================

A (un)complete list of changes in every release.
You can also find:

 * BUG - A know or new bug now fixed.
 
 * REFACTORING - An issue only related to code, that didn't change anything in gameplay.

 * TODO - this issue was in the TODO.txt file of some older versions, or in a TODO comment inside the code.
 
 * BBB - a comment in the code in older versions.
 
 * (!!!) - a VIF (very important feature)!

0.2.0
-----

 * BBB - Change the handle of the character step time: removed the addDistanceWalked methods (pixel based).
   Now is used the new _updateStepTime (time based). This fix an ugly effect on very slow characters.
   
 * TODO - (!!!) Stealth mode.
   Also added some new vector's features to the Vector2 class.
 
 * Healt level now influence the general character speed. More damages lead to a slower movement.
 
 * Added dependency from the KezMenu Python Library, instead of releasing this with the game itself.

 * Added dependency from the KTextSurfaceWriter Python Library, instead of releasing this with the game itself.

 * Now the CTRL key stop the time passing. Always. You can so seek and hunt an enemy.

 * SHIFT key handle stealth, and X key block the hunt and the movement durin attack.
 
 * (!!!) Characters can't see throught all the physical sprites that also block the path.

 * Raindrop now can end inside the game screen.

0.1.1
-----

 * Added the PySetup script for simplify the py2exe releases (thanks to PyMike from pygame community to release this).
 
 * BUG - fixed the long-life bug "character-bouncing-position" after killing an enemy.
   This also fix a bug that breaks presentations with a cblocals.game_speed too high.
 
 * Pressing F1 now switch from window/fullscreen mode.

 * REFACTORING, TODO - replaced the term "dimension" with "size".

 * Added the "check for update" feature.
 
 * Added the new indipendent module ktextsurfacewriter, to generally display a text over a PyGame surface.
 
 * REFACTORING - renamed the _loadEmptySprite GameSprite's method to generateEmptySprite.

 * (!!!) Enhanced the .cbp format, allowing relative time (.cbp version 2.0.0).
   Also rewrited the funny intro to use this new feature (and have better timing).

 * (!!!) Migration to pygame 1.8.
   No real feature migration, but fixed the LevelExit transparency know problem.

 * TODO - Whitespaces in .cbp files are handled in a smarter way (better regexp for .cbp file format).

 * (!!!) Added the darkness and lightrange effects.
