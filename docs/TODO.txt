== Cheese Boys - TODO ==

The project begin to grow a little. I will record here all open problems and issues to do.

=== Open entries ===

Entries I will fix/implement someday.

 * Migration to pygame 1.8.
   This must change many things in my code for use new features.

 * Add character methods properties to get current character bonus/malus to AC, TH0, etc.
  
 * Surnames from Veneto region!
 
 * Stealth mode.
 
 * Shout can warn near enemies.
 
 * REFACTORING - Move the wind attribute from RainDrops effect to GameLevel. The wind can in future influence other
   things like ranged weapon and other sprites.

 * Change keys: CTRL can only stop time, while adding of the SHIFT key can attack without move, and use stealth.
 
 * Add sprites that are not only drawn on the ground but are not physical (like dead corpse, or grass...).
 
 * Handle in a non buggy way the ESC when on a presentation.
 
 * A "Game Over" nice display.
 
 * Speech sprites must not be shadowed, also only shout must be seen outside the screen area.
 
 * REFACTORING - All the draw parts (tips, speech, rain, shadows, ...) must the ordered in the main GameLevel.draw method.

=== Wishlist entries ===

Issues or enhancement I'd like to do someday.
Those aren't needed changes.

  * Add a path finder alghoritm for character movements (at least for NPC).

  * Enhance the enemies random movements.
    Enemies simply must not move to an invalid position.
    
  * REFACTORING - Split Character from CombatCharacter?

  * REFACTORING - Move Attack and character attack infos to other structure, may be merged with TH0 class?
  
  * What about use of the python PIL library?
