Cheese Boys - TODO
==================

The project begin to grow a little. I will record here all open problems and issues to do.

Open entries
------------

Entries I will fix/implement someday.

 * Add the enemy awareness. Non warned enemy are much simpler to backstab.

 * Add character methods properties to get current character bonus/malus to AC, TH0, etc.
  
 * Surnames from Veneto region and other Emilian's ones!
 
 * Shout can warn near enemies.
 
 * REFACTORING - Move the wind attribute from RainDrops effect to GameLevel. The wind can in future influence other
   things like ranged weapon and other sprites.

 * Add sprites that are not only drawn on the ground but are not physical (like dead corpse, or grass...).
 
 * A "Game Over" nice display.
 
 * Only shout must be seen outside the screen area.
 
 * REFACTORING - All the draw parts (tips, speech, rain, shadows, ...) must the ordered in the main GameLevel.draw method.

 * BUG - exit a level during speech in progress make the character to be unable to speak in the next level...
 
 * Draw hit points number anfter damage, floating above the character.
 
 * Remove level_text module (or integrate it) and replace it with KTextSurfaceWriter usage.

Wishlist entries
----------------

Issues or enhancement I'd like to implement someday.
Those aren't needed changes.

 * Integration (but optional) with Psyco?

 * Add a path finder alghoritm for character movements (at least for NPC).

 * Enhance the enemies random movements.
   Enemies simply must not move to an invalid position.
    
 * REFACTORING - Split Character from CombatCharacter?

 * REFACTORING - Move Attack and character attack infos to other structure, may be merged with TH0 class?
  
  * What about use of the python PIL library?
