Will McGugan

PyMike (Pygame community)

Eli Bendersky
-------------
* Thanks for a good tutorial about pathfinding on his blog
  (http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2009/01/09/writing-a-game-in-python-with-pygame-part-iii/).
  This give me the pathfinding module!

Zion
----
Even if Zion is NOT a software developer, I think he was exactly this in a previous life.
Some of his super ideas:

* Plan a future split of the engine and the game.
* Suggest to use manually drawn image instead of tiles (this after the failure of the Gareth's Quest project).
* ...and finally, to be a good friend! :-)
