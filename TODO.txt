== Cheese Boys - TODO ==

The project begin to grow a little. I will record here all open problems and issues to do.

=== Open entries ===

Entries I will fix/implement someday.

 * Add character methods properties to get current character bonus/malus to AC, TH0, etc.
  
 * Surnames from Veneto region!
 
 * Stealth mode.
 
 * Shout can warn enemies, and enemies can shout sometimes (when hitten by blows...)

 * REFACTORING - replace the term "dimension" with "size".
 
 * REFACTORING - Move the wind attribute from RainDrops effect to GameLevel. The wind can in future influence other
   things like ranged weapon and other sprites.

 === Wishlist entries ===

Issues or enhancement I'd like to do someday.
Those aren't a needed changes.

  * Enhance the enemies random movements.
    Enemies simply must not move to an invalid position.

  * REFACTORING - Split Character from CombatCharacter?

  * REFACTORING - Move Attack and character attack infos to other structure, may be merged with TH0 class?
