== Cheese Boys - TODO ==

The project begin to grow a little. I will record here all open problems and issues to do.

=== Open entries ===

Entries I will fix/implement someday.

 * Add character methods properties to get current character bonus/malus to AC, TH0, etc.
 
 * Enhance the enemies random movements.
   Enemies simply must not move to an invalid position.
 
 * Surnames from Veneto region!
 
 * Stealth mode.

 * REFACTORING - replace the term "dimension" with "size".
 
 * REFACTORING - Move Attack and character attack infos to other structure, may be merged with TH0 class?

=== Fixed entries ===

Already closed and fixed.

==== 0.1.0 ====

 * Added the rain effect.

==== 0.0.6 ====

 * BUG - Click outside the game area must not move the hero.

 * Retreat outside the game area must be impossible.

 * BUG - Attack with CTRL pressed.
   Sometimes enemies begin a withdraw when are outside the hero range of attack, just because CTRL is pressed.

 * Added the wave effect on water terrain, and introduced a new utility for a fast add of animations effects.

 * Added an internal Vector2 class for users without the Will McGugan's gameobjects library.
 
 * (!!!) Now the GameGroup.sprites method overwrite the base pygame.Sprite.sprites; sprites are returned ordered by
   their Y position! This is important for game drawing procedure!
 
 * Added line command option parser
